## 问题1
未认证授权的服务
CAS的服务记录是空的，没有定义服务。 希望通过CAS进行认证的应用程序必须在服务记录中明确定义。

Application Not Authorized to Use CAS

You are not authorized to access the application as your account \
is missing privileges required by the CAS server to authenticate into this service. Please notify your support desk.

The application you attempted to authenticate to is not authorized to use CAS. Contact your CAS administrator to learn how you might register and integrate your application with CAS.

The services registry of CAS is empty and has no service definitions. \
Applications that wish to authenticate with CAS must explicitly be defined in the services registry.
